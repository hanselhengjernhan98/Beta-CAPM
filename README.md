# Systematic Risk, Beta Factor and the CAPM Model


__Objectives:__

1. Find out how to calculate Beta 
   - Find out if Beta is stable over time
   - Find out how Beta affects CAPM model

Beta is indeed stable for most stocks!

2. Find out amount of diversifiable risk  for each stock
   - Compare systematic vs unsystematic risk for each stock

__Key Learnings__:
- In a diversified Portfolio, parts of a stock´s total risk can be eliminated.  (unsystematic/diversifiable risk) 
- In a diversified Portfolio, parts of a stock´s total risk can´t be eliminated (systematic risk)
- Investors shouldn´t care about a stock´s diversifiable risk.
- Stock investors should only get compensated for taking systematic/market risk. 
- For single stocks, the relationship between market risk and return should be more meaningful (CAPM model)
- Motivation: CAPM can be helpful to measure and assess single Stock Performance (Benchmarking)


In a diversified Portfolio (MP):
- only a Stock´s systematic Risk (cov with MP, "Market Risk") contributes to the Total Portfolio Risk!
- a Stock´s unsystematic Risk can be eliminated!


 - Market Risk (systematic Risk)__: global economy, market or industry/segment-specific risk factors that apply to many companies.
 - Unsystematic Risk__: company-specific risk-factors (e.g. management) -> "Elon Musk Risk"


- most of the stocks with the exception of WMT APPL and MSFT have higher unsystembatic risk that cannot be diversified. This is especially so for tesla, likely due to Elon Musk's comments that swing prices drastically.
